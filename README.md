# Marble Game

## 1. Description

It is a simple game with the main quest of popping marbles. Created as a "learn by practice" challenge for myself and my better understanding of React.

## 2. Rules

Replace the adjacent marbles to set 3 of a kind in a row or a column. It will make them pop.

One marble pop = 1 point.
Replacing the marbles without popping = -5 points.

You have 30 seconds to pop as many marbles as you can.
Enjoy!
